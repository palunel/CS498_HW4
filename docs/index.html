      As part of my journey through the <b>MCS-DS</b> program I kept detailed logs of the time I spent on each subject
      and each
      task. I would like to present some of the detail here as part of the Week 7 project assignment.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      To date I have spent about <b>730 hours</b> on this program.

      <b>330</b> days have elapsed since my first course started in Fall 2018 of which I spent at total <b>216</b>
      actually studying. On these days, I spend on average <b>3 hours and 36 minutes</b> every day. This averages out at
      about <b>15 hours and 45 minutes</b> each week including all breaks!
    </p>
    <p class="lead">

      has been split amongst the 6 subjects I have taken to date Hover over the slices to see how much time I spent
      on
      each and click through on each slice for more detail! </p>
