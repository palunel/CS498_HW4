      As part of my journey through the <b>MCS-DS</b> program I kept detailed logs of the time I spent on each subject
      and each
      task. I would like to present some of the detail here as part of the Week 7 project assignment.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      To date I have spent about <b>730 hours</b> on this program.

      <b>330 days</b> have elapsed since my first course started in Fall 2018. Of these 330 days I spent total of
      <b>216</b> actually studying at an average <b>3 hours and 36 minutes</b> and a median of
      <b>2 hours 56 minutes</b> every day. This
      averages out at about <b>15 hours and 45 minutes</b> spent behind the keybaord each week including all breaks!
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I have completed 4 subjects to date namely <b>Distributed Systems (DIS)</b> with Prof Gupta, <b>Text Information
        Systems (TIS)</b> with Prof
      Zhai, <b>Cloud Computing Applicaitons (CCA)</b> with Prof Campbell and <b>Applied Machine Learning (AML)</b> with
      Prof
      Forsyth. This term I am completing <b>Theory and Practice of Data Cleaning (TDC)</b> with Prof Ludaescher and
      <b>Data Vizualisation
        (VIZ)</b> with
      Prof Hart.
      With this semester nearly complete, a comparison amongst these 6 subjects makes for interesting reading. It is
      clear that some courses require a significant amount more time than others to complete. To date Applied Machine
      Learning has been the most onerous with Theory and Practice of Data Cleaning the least.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      A further interesting analysis is which component of each subject the most time was spent on. Here I classified
      the
      activities as <b>Lectures</b>, <b>Homework</b>, <b>Machine Problems (MPs)</b>, <b>Assignments</b>,
      <b>Projects</b>, <b>Exam and
        Prep</b> as well as <b>Pre-work</b> which
      entailed work I did prior to some courses to understand some of the upcoming concepts better. The takeaway here
      for me was that each subject was unique in its approach, with some placing more emphasis on homework and less
      on
      exams while project work formed the bulk of the work for others.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      Finally, with the MCS-DS being a part time program which I need to complete outside my working
      hours, I find it interesting to see on which days I tend to spend most of my time studying. As expected, it is the
      weekends! A further interesting (but understandable) outcome was that Friday evenings I tend to do less than on
      other evenings.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I have provided two visualizations to show and explore these insights a bit more. The first shows
      the relative
      distribution of time spent on each subject. Drilling down on the data points provide some more insights in the
      different areas in each subject that I spent the most time.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      The second visualisation breaks the time spent into week days with the drill down providing insights
      into how each of the subjects were tackled on each of the days.
